Welcome to my small project, this project is a webapp created for the use of the soldiers at Shotef's warehouse over at base Tira 6013 of the IDF.
<br></br>
**Features:**
* The Indexer (A search tool that outputs the physical location of an item based of it's name or it's ID.)
* The QR-Reader (A custom QR-Reader created to scan custom QR-Codes that are distributed at the warehouse.)
* The advanced "Orders Sorter" (A system I developed to increase productivity and shorten work times.)
* The map (A simple map for the use of new or confused soldiers.)
